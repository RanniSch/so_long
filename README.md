This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to work with textures, sprites and some other very basic gameplay elements. <br> <br>

The playerâ€™s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape chosing the shortest possible route. <br>
To play the game, you must have Xming installed, as the program displays the image in a window. <br> <br>
The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right. <br>
At every move, the current number of movements is displayed in the shell. <br> <br>
